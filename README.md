# Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Assignment

This is my assignment for my college module *Programming for Data Analysis* taught by Dr Brian McGinley. The assignment was to explain the use of the numpy.random package. The 4 criteria for the assignment are:

- Explain the overall purpose of the package.
- Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
- Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
- Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

This assignment repository contains one Jupyter notebook named "NumPy random package explained", this README, and the assignment brief in pdf form.

### How to run the Jupyter notebook:

The notebook can be run from top to bottom. Although the produced graphs and numbers are meant as aid to the explanation I tried to make it as interactive as I could. Through out if the top of a code cell has variables like `mu = 20` and `lam = 1` these can be changed in order to see the changes it will make on the graphs. Changing these and observing the output may help supplement the learning process.
